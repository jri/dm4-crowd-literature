DeepaMehta 4 is a platform for collaboration and knowledge management:  
<https://github.com/jri/deepamehta>


Running locally
---------------

After installation go to:  
<http://localhost:8080/eu.crowd-literature/>


Development
-----------

For a save-reload turnaround start the frontend directly from the DeepaMehta file repository:

    http://localhost:8080/filerepo/dm4-crowd-literature/src/main/resources/web/

Now, when you edit any client-side resource (Javascript, HTML, CSS, ...) save it and press reload in the browser.
Your changes will appear immediately. No building required.

3 requirements for this to work:

* The `jri/dm4-crowd-literature` git repo is cloned inside DM's `modules-external` directory.

* In DM's `pom.xml` the file repo is configured this way:

    `<dm4.filerepo.path>${project.basedir}/modules-external</dm4.filerepo.path>`

* In CROWD's `src/main/resources/web/index.html` comment this line:

    `<base href="/eu.crowd-literature/">`
